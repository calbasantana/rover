# Introduction
I have developed this open-source rover platform over the last few years as a means of expanding my students' understanding of physics concepts by applying them in real-life scenarios. This is a companion repository to the rover challenges repository.

This features a custom-made PCB, lasercut and 3D-printed hardware, as well as low cost motors. It is not perfect by any means, but it has resulted in really high engagement in my students over the years. What follows are the many different facets of this platform, starting off with the materials.

# Rover Materials

## Custom-PCB

## Microcontroller, Motors, and Motor Drivers

# Rover Body

The most efficient way of making the body for the rover is to lasercut most of it. This is because lasercutting is much quicker than 3D printing and can be great for rapid prototyping. I usually have students lasercut cardboard designs first to ensure their dimensions are correct and then final designs are made on 3mm/6mm plywood.

## OnShape

Designs are made on OnShape at the following website:

This is a free online CAD tool, available on all devices and can run even on the most limited of hardware machines.

### OnShape Tutorial

I ask my students to follow the OnShape Tutorial first, creating a skateboard to familiarize themselves with the tools of OnShape. Most useful are the sketch, extrude, mirror, and dimension tools.

I wanted a simple design for this NFC Holder. I designed it on OnShape and then proceeded to print it using my Original Prusa Mini+ and using PrusaSlicer.

# NFC Tag
![Image_4](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c1b4d1c5-4d13-4bfa-ba43-939e600c45c2)
The NFC tag is pretty simple to program using an Android phone and I’m sure you can use an iPhone as well.
# Initialization & Material(s)
Below you will find how I programmed the NFC tag and where it was purchased from.
## Initialization
I downloaded an app on the Play Store called NFC Tools; it is by wakdev. This app is incredibly useful and easy to use. When you first boot it up, this is what you’ll likely see:
![Image_5](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/709e5967-18a4-4f82-8129-4af43c3fc6cd)
From here, tap your NFC tag; the following menu will appear.
![Image_6](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3fd644d4-7bb9-46e7-9eba-37c86f9be996)
Go to Write -> Add a record -> Wi-Fi network. Enter the details of your WiFi network. Most home networks will be WPA2-Personal, with encryption “None” Then enter your WiFi network’s name and password. Make sure to abide by all letter cases in your WiFi network.
![Image_7](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ba18c4d6-4081-48e1-9223-4f5cc5dcb9ef)
The last thing left is the most critical: Make sure to press the “Write” button and then step away from your NFC tag and approach it again. Once it is completed, you should see this:
![Image_8](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/31dc1378-8515-458f-8f18-602377ca62ee)
Now, the next time you approach the NFC tag, you will be prompted on whether on not you wish to join the WiFi network written on it.

# Tips
You may have an issue ensuring that your phone can read the NFC tag. I recommend, for at least Android and the process is likely similar for iOS, going to Settings -> Connected Devices -> Connection Preferences -> NFC (and turn this on).

Your guests may also have issues connecting to the network if their phone has a thick case or if they are not tapping the correct part of the phone to the NFC tag. Removing the case and moving the phone around until it reads the tag helps with this, but this is easier for some than others.

I used some velcro to attach the WiFi NFC Tag to the wall near the entrance of my house so guests have easy access, but I also have a copy lying around on a desk near the kitchen. You can do whatever floats your boat.
